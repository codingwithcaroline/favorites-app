THE FIREBASE PACKAGES WOULD NOT LOAD. I WILL NEED THE GRADER TO ADD THE PACKAGES ON THEIR DEVICE FOR THE APP TO RUN. HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED:
Add package dependencies from the most recent: https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.
THESE ARE THE PACKAGES YOU NEED FROM THAT:
FirebaseAuth
FirebaseFirestore
FirebaseFirestoreSwift
